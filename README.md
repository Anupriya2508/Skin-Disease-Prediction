## Overview

This repository contains a deep learning model for automated multiclass dermatological diagnosis prediction from skin images. The model is based on an improved Mobile-Net architecture and has been trained on the HAM10000 dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is the HAM10000 dataset, which consists of images of various skin lesions.

## Model Architecture

The model is built using an improved Mobile-Net architecture, optimized for dermatological image classification. The architecture has been fine-tuned to achieve better accuracy and performance in predicting multiclass skin diseases.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dermatological-diagnosis.git
    cd dermatological-diagnosis
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Results

The model achieves a high accuracy on the test set from the HAM10000 dataset.
